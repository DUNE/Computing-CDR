(grouping to be refined)
\begin{itemize}
    \item identification/login 
    \item running DUNE software
    \item handling data
    \item collaborative code
    \item grid specific
    \item machine learning tools and practices
\end{itemize}
Does it make sense to split in roles, e.g. specific to ``production", ``sim/reco" 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Areas of training 
    \item Survey work in order to target relevant tutorials/What training DUNE collaborators need?
    \item Designing future training sessions (in collaboration with HEP Software Foundation, stealing ideas from past workshops, experimenting with new platforms)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Documentation}
New DUNE Wiki
\begin{itemize}
