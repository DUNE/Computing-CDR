\chapter{Applications overview}
\label{ch:appl}

This chapter describes the current state of the simulation, reconstruction, and analysis applications, the resource usage and the plans for future development.  Algorithms for ProtoDUNE-SP and the single-phase far detector modules are fairly mature, while algorithms for the near detector, the dual-phase far-detector module(s), and the Module of Opportunity are in an earlier stage of development.
