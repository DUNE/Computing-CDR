The Data Management subsystem serves the function of bringing data from the detectors to the archival storage facility 
and then distributing it to storage elements around the world.  The components include a data ingest manager, a replica manager that knows the 
location of files and manages the transfers between storage element, a metadata server which keeps track of the types and 
provenance of data, and an interface to deliver the appropriate files to the workflow management system and interactive users.
