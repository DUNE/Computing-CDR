DUNE intends to use CRIC as a central source of information about sites and their compute and storage services. CRIC is routinely used by ATLAS and CMS with OSG and other WLCG resources, and is also familiar to site administrators. 

An evaluation of CRIC is being done, with information about sites obtained from the configurations of the OSG pilot factories. This is browsable via the CRIC web dashboard, and also used to generate XML files in the VO Feed format required by the ETF testing framework used for monitoring.
