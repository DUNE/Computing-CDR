\chapter{Information Systems \hideme{McNab}}
\label{ch:is}

DUNE intends to use \dword{cric} \fixme{dword needs def} as a central source of information about sites and their compute and storage services. \dword{cric} is routinely used by ATLAS and CMS with \dword{osg} and other \dword{wlcg} resources, and is also familiar to site administrators. 

An evaluation of \dword{cric} is being done, with information about sites obtained from the configurations of the \dword{osg} pilot factories. This is browsable via the \dword{cric} web dashboard, and also used to generate XML files in the \dword{vo} Feed format required by the \dword{etf} testing framework used for monitoring.
